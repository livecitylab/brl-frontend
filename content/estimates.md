title: Estimate your rent
---

Our rent estimates help you to plan for your rent search. Based on live updating rental data our machine learning algorithm provides you with an estimate of what rent you can expect to pay. Just enter the specifications of the flat your looking and in which part of Berlin you want to live.

Our estimates give you a range in which we expect your rent to be. This estimation cannot be 100% accurate. There are several factors that our model can't take into account. Yet, being based on data from rental platforms it provides you with a live estimate and gives you a starting point for your flat hunt!
